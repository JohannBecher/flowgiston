              <h1>What is Quality of Identity?</h1>
              <p>
                Quality of Identity summarizes the approach we have taken to a peer-to-peer technology we call Agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here you will find information about <strong>Agents</strong>&mdash;an application that allows individuals
                and other entities to have:
              </p>
              <ul class="b_flourish">
                <li>Fined grained control of access to information</li>
                <li>Very strong anonymity <strong>and</strong> Very strong assurances of identity</li>
                <li>Participation in a distributed and robust reputation system</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
              <p>
                Information we create and own is being taken from us as the price to use online tools for connecting,
                communicating, and acquiring information online. This information is being sold back to us in the form of
                targeted advertising, security products, monitoring products, and access fees. Our effort is to offer an
                alternative that provides an infrastructure that is more secure than centralized solutions, tools that make
                managing quality of identity easy and intuitive, and an accessible and extensible programming model.
              </p>
              <h2>The Technology</h2>
              <p>
                This is a deep and rich technology and the information on this site is only an overview and is a work in
                progress. We make some seemingly outrageous claims and the final proof of those claims is in the
                <a id="toggle_text">code</a>. 
              </p>
              <p id="toggled_text">
                The underlying data management and communication infrastructure can be found in the GitHub repository for
                <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/leithaus/SpecialK">SpecialK</a>. We will release the protocols
                and user interface code to open source as they reach a level of maturity.
              </p>
              <h2>Join Us</h2>
              <p>
                We will soon announce a crowdfunding campaign to attract wider participation in applying this technology to
                create distributed economies. A successful crowdfunding campaign will provide funding to enhance properties
                and user interface tools to Agents; the more money raised the more intuitive and efficient using Agents in
                an Abundant Exchange will be.

                    Each Agent is self contained and can be directly accessed and controlled only by it&rsquo;s owner. There
                    is no dependence on a metasystem or directory, including IP addressing or tracker.

                    Any two Agents can share a secret (a unique identifier and, optionally an encryption mechanism) that
                    allows each to identify communications from each other. That identifier is extremely difficult to
                    discover and, when encryption of communications is added, nearly impossible to eavesdrop, intercept,
                    or imitate.

                    Any Agent can create a authenticated connection with another through the process of an Introduction.
                    If either Agent deletes the connection, then neither Agent can communicate directly with the other.

                    An Agent can be backed up and deleted on one machine and reinstalled on another machine in a different
                    location and still be able to communicate to all Agents it was previously connected to, including
                    messages that were on-route before relocating. Agents can communicate over multiple networks, as long
                    as there is at least one accessible Agent spanning the networks.

                    An Agent that is relying on another Agent to behave in a specific way has the ability to verify certain
                    properties of the other Agent through model checking. For example, a provable property can include
                    allowing forwarding of only specific information, such as a doctor viewing my medical records, but not
                    being able to forward them to anyone else. Another provable property is the ability to correctly
                    participate in a distributed transaction, like exchanges in the AbundX Exchange.

                    Agents store and retrieve information via labels. Any piece of information can have any number of labels,

                    &rarr; Picture-of-My-House</em> and <em>Houses &rarr; Home &rarr; Picture-of-My-House.</em>

                    Our best estimate at this time is on the order of $20 to $50 per year with good security and redundancy.
                    We will be offering an offshore, hardened, highly secure, premium hosting solution through a partner, but

                    No! Facebook provides valuable services that Agents are not designed to replace. There will be some
                    information and activities that are best hosted by FB and some that are more suitable to a secure P2P
                    network that has assurances of control and quality. Where there is overlap, each individual can decide
                    which provides the best value.

                  <p>
                    For every attack by an adversary, Agents have one or more effective defenses that are easier and cheaper
                    to implement. In the current Internet, the attacker has the advantage. For example, if the private key is
                    obtained through brute force to a public key encrypted network address, then all information at that
                    address will be accessible. A much greater effort would be required to obtain only one piece of Agent
                    managed information.

                    Through Labels and the Web of Provenance. Any piece of data, for example the picture of a bicycle, can
                    have labels, for example, &ldquo;for sale&rdquo;, &ldquo;used&rdquo;, &ldquo;well maintained&rdquo;, and
                    &ldquo;belongs to me&rdquo;. Those labels have no use to anyone else, without some means to verify them.
                    Any piece of Agent information can be supported in a Web of Provenance. For example, the local bicycle
                    shop could provide evidence that I purchased the bicycle 2 years ago. Several dozen people can provide
                    evidence that I have provided well maintained items in the past. The p2p exchange can show I have executed
                    hundreds of transactions with no complaints from providers or receivers.

                  <p>
                    First, it is purely optional. Second, providing evidence to support other Agent&rsquo;s qualities
                    typically is no more effort than assigning a label to a piece of information. From then on, all
                    verifications can occur automatically.

                    Agents are single user applications and not built for multiple simultaneous users, so performance would
                    rapidly deteriorate, if many people tried to use the prototype simultaneously.

                  <p>
                    A relationship can be thought of as the sum of the qualities of identity each person has with another
                    plus expectations, emotions, and physical contact. Further, your qualities of identity can extend to
                    others you may have no relationship with, or even know your identity. For example, your expert opinion
                    supporting a fact is not strengthened by your name, but by your expertise, education, and experiences;
                    someone who has no relationship to you may rely on that fact on the strength of qualities of your
                    identity. By having tools to manage our identity, management of relationships follows easily and many more
                    types and variations of relationships are possible. We can also gain control of who has access to our
                    information and how it is used.

                Agents represent the next major step of evolution of the network that Van Jacobson envisioned as
                &ldquo;<a rel="external" href=" http://scitalks.com/video.php?id=223166">Dissemination (focus on the data)</a>&rdquo;.
                This next step allows for a quality-based network that is no more complex than TCP/IP was when it was
                introduced and changed the definition of the network from path-based telephony making the Internet possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The qualities that the <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#.22Code_is_law.22">code</a>
                of this new network of Agents enforce include strong authentication, granular control of data, verification
                of claims, strong anonymity, reliable distributed transactions, and communications that can be significantly
                more secure than what is feasible on the current Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to provide an alternative to existing cyber communication that can support information quality as
                part of the code, which is in turn based upon a mathematical model. The technology we developed is an
                application that can be implemented on any connected computer. The technology operates on the existing
                Internet, but is not be limited to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specifically, an Agent will provide:
              </p>
              <ul class="b_flourish">
                <li>
                  The ability to easily create persistent, mutual, secure, and verifiable Connections that are independent
                  of any identity meta-system or central authority, including network addressing
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ability to easily and reliably control access to information
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ability to execute highly reliable peer-to-peer transactions
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The underlying infrastructure is in the open source repository for
                <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/leithaus/SpecialK">SpecialK</a>. We will be adding the Agent
                protocols and an individual Agent front-end application in the coming weeks. Additional technical
                documentation can be found there as well.

              <h1>Licensing</h1>
              <p>
                All code for individual Agents and AbundX Agents will be open source. Agent to Agent messaging is licensed by
                Agent Technology Inc., which has no licensing requirement for individuals, non-profit businesses, and non-G20
                governments. In other words, it is free for your personal use. You don&rsquo;t even have to register the
                software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agent Technology Inc introduces a novel licensing model, which we call &ldquo;forward innovation&rdquo;. We
                believe that those that invest in developing an idea should have the right to be rewarded for taking the risk
                and putting in the effort, but not at the cost of preventing others from innovating further.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agent Technology Inc. recognizes that it has built on a huge body of others&rsquo; innovation, so any fee
                charged for-profit and G-20 uses of this technology is meant to represent the incremental contribution of
                Agent Technology&rsquo;s innovation and will be nominal. License fees will be easy to calculate and have
                little material effect on the bottom line of companies and governments that use this technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyone who builds on this technology is free to make money from their innovation, as long as it does not
                inhibit further innovation and profit only represents the incremental contribution. Specifically, use of this
                technology cannot inhibit further innovation, by price, copyright, or patents. We call this forward
                innovation, since any attempt to use price, copyright, or patents to prevent further innovation or competition
                will allow the party accused of infringement to use this license as protection.

              <h1>What is Quality of Identity?</h1>
              <p>
                Identity can be thought of as the observable or knowable information about a person. The veracity, relevance,
                and completeness of this information are integral parts of the qualities of identity. By this definition, each
                person&rsquo;s quality of identity is different, if only slightly, with every other person he or she interacts
                with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some qualities of identity include:
              </p>
              <ul class="b_flourish">
                <li>Personally identifiable information (PII), such as your names and addresses</li>
                <li>Profession, title, work history</li>
                <li>Expertise, curriculum vitae</li>
                <li>Education, grades, schools</li>
                <li>Connections, such as friends, associates, acquaintances</li>
                <li>Communications, content and with whom, was the information asked for or offered?</li>
                <li>Activities and experiences</li>
                <li>Artifacts created, such a pictures and music</li>
                <li>Likes, dislikes, and other opinions</li>
                <li>Medical condition and history</li>
                <li>Others&rsquo; assessment, such as recommendations, endorsements</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Identity vs Identification</h2>
              <p>
                Identity does not have to include personally identifiable information, for example when two people know each
                other by sight and not by name, or by an alias used online. Verified anonymity is where I can have assurances
                of certain qualities of identity of another, but not have the ability to attach that information to a specific
                person.
              </p>
              <p>
                A key component to information verification is the ability to use reputation independent of identification.
                Verified anonymity allows an individual to have qualities of their identity supported by others without
                revealing personally identifiable information. This is very common in day-to-day interactions, but is
                virtually non-existent online. Every time you vote, or reference the source of information as a title or role
                (&ldquo;a doctor told me&rdquo;) you are using verified anonymity.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Why Quality of Identity is Important</h2>
              <p>
                The quality of information we encounter through various media and interactions is deteriorating rapidly.
                Quantity and volume have replaced quality and verification. In order to make better decisions, solve the
                right problems, and prioritize our efforts we need to have easy access to the qualities of the information
                we seek and receive.
              </p>
              <p>
                All evidence of the qualities of information eventually comes from an individual or entity. The extent to
                which that evidence is accepted and acted upon is dependent upon the perceived qualities the receiver has
                for the provider of the evidence, in other words, the quality of identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                This dynamic is taken for granted in everyday person-to-person interaction, but is poorly supported on
                the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                If every claim we make that we want people to act upon is supportable by leveraging the web of quality of
                identities, then we increase our influence. If we can easily verify claims others make by having a view of
                the qualities of identities supporting those claims, we can make better decisions.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Agents and Quality of Identity</h2>
              <p>
                Our approach to managing online identity is to provide the ability to easily manage access to our
                information and easily participate in and leverage a web of provenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                One approach to improving the quality of information is to make all information free and accessible. This
                may be possible, but in today&rsquo;s world such an approach does not reward the creative only the compilers.
                And it creates an undue dependency on the compilers and undue influence through choosing what information
                and evidence is made most available.
              </p>
              <p>
                An alternative to the two choices of centralized control of information and completely open and free
                information is distributed control of information: each creator of information has control over both who has
                access to their information and how it is used.
              </p>

              <h1>Web of Provenance</h1>
              <p>
                <strong>Provenance:</strong> <em>place or source of origin.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                The truthfulness or factualness of a piece of information can be supported by evidence, or the source(s) of
                the claim of truthfulness or factuality.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Web of Provenance takes three forms: transparency, peer support (similar to a web of trust) and
                authorities.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Transparency</h2>
              <p>
                The ability to see activities of others can be accomplished in certain circumstances: All are willing
                participants, all have equal access to information, and, optionally, participants are anonymous, but verified
                by an authority (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                An example of transparency is the AbundX. All messages and transactions are visible to all participants. Thus
                it is possible to see the interactions and exchanges of everyone in an AbundX. Information in the exchange is
                extremely difficult to alter once it has been posted, so it is highly unlikely that someone has re-written
                history to suit themselves.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Peer Support</h2>
              <p>
                Any Agent can verify claims made by another Agent and optionally provide additional evidence. This capability
                has rich capabilities that include reliable verification through multiple degrees of separation and verified
                anonymity. We will be posting demonstrations to illustrate some of this potential in the near future.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Authority of Curated Support</h2>
              <p>
                An Agent that is specifically used to validate claims is called a Curator Service. Any Agent can act as a
                Curator Service, but specialized Agents can be used specifically for the act of curating evidence to support
                information presented by others. For example, a law office may verify residency and identity. The law firm
                would set up a Curator Service to provide verification for their clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curator Services are designed to be hosted by third parties that have a vested interest in the veracity of the
                evidence they are presenting. The host of a Curator would typically have a published process they follow to
                validate evidence of a claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Web of Provenance introduces three key innovations that avoid some significant problems of current trust
                architectures, can build upon their capabilities, and provide new capabilities that would be difficult to
                accomplish without a Web of Provenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first key innovation of Curator Services is that they do not provide evidence of a claim without the
                permission of the claimant.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="/img/quality_of_id_curator_service_graphic.png" width="560" height="420" alt="">
              </p>
              <p>
                This ternary conversation is only possible if the claimant is consistently available to validate the
                legitimacy of the request to check the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the Curator Service supporting a claim is a connection of the Agent, secure communication can be
                implemented between the claimant and the Curator Service to severely inhibit circumvention.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second key innovation of Curator Services is the separation of the action of trust from the evidence.
                Depending upon the consequences of betrayal of trust, the recipient of a claim may need more evidence than
                one Curator Service provides. The recipient may want to explore the Web of Provenance around a claim before
                deciding to trust a claim. In the Web of Provenance, this can be accomplished with the click of a mouse.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="/img/quality_of_id_web_of_provencance_graphic.png" width="560" height="420" alt="">
              </p>
              <p>
                The third key innovation of Curator Services is the separation of the source of the evidence from the evidence
                itself. This innovation creates three significant capabilities:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  It is possible to supply the evidence without revealing the source
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is possible to supply the source of evidence without revealing the evidence
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is possible to create &ldquo;blinds&rdquo; that separate the evidence from the source so that no one data
                  source is able to link the two.
                </li>
              </ol>
