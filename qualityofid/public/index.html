              <h1>The Story</h1>
              <p>
                Quality of Identity summarizes the approach we have taken to a peer-to-peer technology we call Agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                An <strong>Agent</strong> is an application that allows individuals and other entities to have:
              </p>
              <ul class="b_flourish">
                <li>Fined grained control of access to information</li>
                <li>Very strong anonymity AND Very strong assurances of identity</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is a deep and rich technology and the information on this site is only an overview and is a work in progress.
                We make some seemingly outrageous claims and the final proof of those claims is in the code.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden">
                The underlying data management and communication infrastructure can be found in the GitHub repository for
                <a href="https://github.com/leithaus/SpecialK">SpecialK</a>. We will release the protocols and user interface code
                to open source if we are funded by our Kickstarter campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are very excited about the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launch of
                <a class="axlink" href="http://abundx.com/">Abund<span class="x">X</span></a>. The successful crowdfunding
                campaign will add properties and user interface tools to Agents; the more money raised the more intuitive and
                efficient using Agents in an Abundant Exchange will be.

                    deletes the connection, then neither Agent can communicate directly with the other.

                    An Agent that is relying on another Agent to behave in a specific way has the ability to verify certain properties
                    of the other Agent through model checking. For example, a provable property can include allowing forwarding of only
                    specific information, such as a doctor viewing my medical records, but not being able to forward them to anyone else.
                    Another provable property is the ability to correctly participate in a distributed transaction, like exchanges in the
                    AbundX Exchange.

                    No! Facebook provides valuable services that Agents are not designed to replace. There will be some information and
                    activities that are best hosted by FB and some that are more suitable to a secure P2P network that has assurances of
                    control and quality. Where there is overlap, each individual can decide which provides the best value.

                  <p>
                    For every attack by an adversary, Agents have one or more effective defenses that are easier and cheaper to implement.
                    In the current Internet, the attacker has the advantage. For example, if the private key is obtained through brute
                    force to a public key encrypted network address, then all information at that address will be accessible. A much
                    greater effort would be required to obtain only one piece of Agent managed information.

                    Through Labels and the Web of Provenance. Any piece of data, for example the picture of a bicycle, can have labels, for
                    example, &ldquo;for sale&rdquo;, &ldquo;used&rdquo;, &ldquo;well maintained&rdquo;, and &ldquo;belongs to me&rdquo;.
                    Those labels have no use to anyone else, without some means to verify them. Any piece of Agent information can be supported
                    in a Web of Provenance. For example, the local bicycle shop could provide evidence that I purchased the bicycle 2 years ago.
                    Several dozen people can provide evidence that I have provided well maintained items in the past. The p2p exchange can
                    show I have executed hundreds of transactions with no complaints from providers or receivers.

                  <p>
                    First, it is purely optional. Second, providing evidence to support other Agent&rsquo;s qualities typically is no more
                    effort than assigning a label to a piece of information. From then on, all verifications can occur automatically.

              <h1>Technical Overview</h1>
              <p>
                Agents represent the next major step of evolution of the network that Van Jacobson envisioned as
                &ldquo;<a href=" http://scitalks.com/video.php?id=223166">Dissemination (focus on the data)</a>&rdquo;.
                This next step allows for a quality-based network that is no more complex than TCP/IP was
                when it was introduced and changed the definition of the network from path-based telephony making the Internet possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The qualities that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#.22Code_is_law.22">code</a>
                of this new network of Agents enforce include strong authentication, granular control of
                data, verification of claims, strong anonymity, reliable distributed transactions, and communications that can be
                significantly more secure than what is feasible on the current Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to provide an alternative to existing cyber communication that can support information quality as part of
                the code, which is in turn based upon a mathematical model. The technology we developed is an application that can be
                implemented on any connected computer. The technology operates on the existing Internet, but is not be limited to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specifically, an Agent will provide:
              </p>
              <ul class="b_flourish">
                <li>
                  The ability to easily create persistent, mutual, secure, and verifiable Connections that are independent of any identity
                  meta-system or central authority, including network addressing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ability to easily and reliably control access to information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ability to execute highly reliable peer-to-peer transactions.

              <p>
                Agent Technology Inc introduces a novel licensing model, which we call &ldquo;forward innovation&rdquo;. We believe
                that those that invest in developing an idea should have the right to be rewarded for taking the risk and putting
                in the effort, but not at the cost of preventing others from innovating further.
              </p>

              <h1>Introduction to Quality of Identity</h1>
              <p>
                The quality of information on the Internet is declining rapidly. The loudest voices get heard and too often
                believed as true. If we are to innovate and collaborate, we have to improve the quality of information we
                receive and use.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve the quality of information on the Internet two things must change:  quality not quantity must be
                rewarded and evidence of quality easily curated and accessed.
              </p>
              <p>
                This may be obvious and we are not the first to realize this, but this realization is only the lever of change.
                We think we have found the fulcrum that will allow us to apply a small change in technology to have a big
                effect socially.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fulcrum is creating a means to support qualities of identity. All evidence of truth eventually comes
                from an individual or entity and the extent to which that evidence is accepted and acted upon is dependent
                upon the relationship between the receiver and the provider of the evidence. That relationship is the
                identity the provider has for the receiver and that identity is different for every receiver.
              </p>
              <p>
                This reality is taken for granted in every day person-to-person interaction, but is poorly supported on
                the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                If every claim we make that we want people to act upon is supportable by leveraging the web of identities,
                then we increase our influence. If we can easily verify claims others make, we can make better decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                An approach by those who have made this realization in the past have concluded that &ldquo;information wants
                to be free&rdquo; and only by allowing everyone to have access to every thing can we make better decisions.
                This may be theoretically true, but in today&rsquo;s world such an approach does not reward the creative
                only the compilers.

              <h1>Web of Provenance</h1>
              <p>
                <strong>Provenance:</strong> <em>place or source of origin.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                The truthfulness or factualness of a piece of information can be supported by evidence, or the source(s)
                of the claim of truthfulness or factuality.
              </p>
              <p>
                An Agent that is specifically used to validate claims is called a Curator Service. Any Agent can act as
                a Curator Service, but specialized Agents can be used specifically for the act of curating evidence to
                support information presented by others. For example, a law office may verify residency and identity.
                The law firm would set up a Curator Service to provide verification for their clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Curator Services are designed to be hosted by third parties that have a vested interest in the veracity of the
                evidence they are presenting. The host of a Curator would typically have a published process they follow to
                validate evidence of a claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Web of Provenance introduces three key innovations that avoid some significant problems of current trust
                architectures, can build upon their capabilities, and provide new capabilities that would be difficult to
                accomplish without a Web of Provenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first key innovation of Curator Services is that they do not provide evidence of a claim without the permission of the claimant.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="/img/quality_of_id_curator_service_graphic.png" width="560" height="420" alt="">
              </p>
              <p>
                This ternary conversation is only possible if the claimant is consistently available to validate the legitimacy of the
                request to check the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the Curator Service supporting a claim is a connection of the Agent, secure communication can be implemented
                between the claimant and the Curator Service to severely inhibit circumvention.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second key innovation of Curator Services is the separation of the action of trust from the evidence. Depending upon
                the consequences of betrayal of trust, the recipient of a claim may need more evidence than one Curator Service provides.
                The recipient may want to explore the Web of Provenance around a claim before deciding to trust a claim. In the Web of
                Provenance, this can be accomplished with the click of a mouse.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="/img/quality_of_id_web_of_provencance_graphic.png" width="560" height="420" alt="">
              </p>
              <p>
                The third key innovation of Curator Services is the separation of the source of the evidence from the evidence itself.
                This innovation creates three significant capabilities:
              </p>
              <ol class="b_flourish">
                <li>
                  First, it is possible to supply the evidence without revealing the source.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second, it is possible to supply the source of evidence without revealing the evidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Third, it is possible to create &ldquo;blinds&rdquo; that separate the evidence from the source so that no one data source is able to link the two.
                </li>
              </ol>
