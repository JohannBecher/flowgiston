              <h1>AbundX</h1>
              <p>
                Welcome to AbundX where we are building the AbundX Agent that can be used to create efficient and trustworthy
                peer to peer exchanges: Abundant Exchanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AbundX Agent is your personal online representative to help you participate in peer-to-peer exchanges while
                protecting your privacy and providing a robust reputation system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AbundX Agent will enable a multi-way exchange of goods and services without cash or a central authority. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In an Abundant Exchange, or AbundX, you can give something to one person and receive something you value as much
                or more from another person. The AbundX helps link a circle of people who each give something and receive
                something in return.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each person controls an application we call an AbundX Agent, that links with other Agents. People can create
                an authenticated and secure connection to each other through their Agents. This connection is called peer to
                peer because no central controller or coordinator is necessary for two Agents to communicate. <strong>Every
                AbundX Agent is equal and no Agent has special powers over other Agents.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to connecting one to one, An Agents can connect to a group of Agents, we call a Graph. A message to the
                Graph can be accessed by any Agent in the Graph. An Abundant Exchange is a Graph of AbundX Agents who wish to exchange
                goods and services.
              </p>
              <p>
                A message posted to an AbundX is like posting to a bulletin board. Anyone who has access to the bulletin board can
                post and read any message, even those created before she became a member.
              </p>
              <p>
                Messages to an AbundX are offers and needs. AbundX Agents provide tools for sorting, filtering, and posting messages.
                An AbundX Agent can recognize when it is part of a closed loop of offers and needs. Each AbundX Agents in the circle
                participates in a distributed transaction that ensures that either everyone agrees to the exchange, or no one is obligated.
              </p>
              
              <h1>AbundX: A More Detailed Description</h1>
              <p>
                The technology we have developed facilitates a multi-way exchange of subjective value without conversion to a central
                currency or any requirement of a central or federated authority or exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                This multi-way exchange system more closely resembles pre-currency economies, but uses technology to be even more
                efficient, reliable, and secure than centralized currencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mechanisms for establishing secure connections independent of personal identity, enabling variable levels of trust,
                and verification of information through a Web of Provenance are provided in an infrastructure that is more secure
                than standard Internet technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key behaviors of the infrastructure are based upon a mathematical model and can be proven with formal methods. For

              <p>
                We have already done all the heavy lifting on our own dime. Many person years in sweat equity and hundreds of
                thousands of dollars have gone into defining and building the supporting technology to date. The only remaining
                technology barriers that need to be addressed are user experience improvements and installation streamlining.
                Both are well understood using established skill sets.

              <h1>FAQ about the AbundX Exchange</h1>
              <dl id="faq1" class="faq">
                <dt id="faq1q1">
                  How can each person receive something of more value than what he or she gave? Doesn&rsquo;t someone have to lose?

                <dd id="faq1q1a">
                  <p>
                    Because <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_division">we all value different
                    qualities differently</a>, it is possible for everyone to get back more than what they gave. For
                    example, when I have plenty of something I may be willing to exchange it for something I need
                    more. It is very possible, and perhaps typical, that everyone in a circle of exchanges may consider what they
                    receive to be of greater value than that was given. In a centralized system, either currency or barter, someone
                    probably looses, since the central authority usually takes some percentage of every transaction.

                  <p>
                    We are not qualified to offer tax advice but can point out these characteristics that may apply:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="b_pro">
                    <li>
                      There is no central authority to monitor exchanges, so there is no entity that can be made responsible
                      for reporting exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exchanges are not reduced to a dollar value, so assessing the dollar value of an exchange is open
                      to wide interpretation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exchanges are not limited to agreements between two people. There may be several people involved in
                      a single transaction. What is given is independent of what is received. In other words: my obligation
                      to deliver an offer is in effect even if the person delivering an offer to me reneges. My obligation
                      to deliver is enforced by a desire to maintain my reputation, not enforced by a contract.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </dd>
              
                <dt id="faq1q3">
                  Isn&rsquo;t Abundant Exchange just like Socialism?
                </dt>
                <dd id="faq1q3a">
                  <p>
                    Quite the opposite. Currency systems are much more &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; than a distributed exchange
                    system because currency systems are centrally controlled and require everything exchanged to be reduced to a
                    single measurement determined by the society. A distributed exchange system allows each person to determine
                    the qualities of goods and service he or she most values.
                  </p>
                </dd>
              
                <dt id="faq1q4">
                  Why do I need to access the exchange through an Agent and not just post offers and needs to a
                  central location?
                </dt>
                <dd id="faq1q4a">
                  <p>
                    In addition to secure communications and privacy protections, using an Agent in an exchange allows
                    everyone in the exchange to see a history of transactions. History builds reputation and confidence
                    in the exchange allowing higher value goods and services to be exchanged and promises made (stored
                    value) over longer time periods. Communication through Agents provides assurances of the accuracy
                    of claims made through the Agent using the Web of Provenance.

                    Local and exchange-based currencies can address the issue of scarcity, and to some extent the
                    centralization bias through expiration and devaluation. Local currencies allow more complex exchanges
                    than this early version of the AbundX Agent, but at the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of needing to reduce all
                    qualities down to a single metric.

                  <p>
                    BitCoin is similar to AbundX in the lack of a central authority that can track and control supply.
                    But BitCoin derives its value through scarcity and thus encourages hoarding. Like central currencies,
                    BitCoin require all qualities to be expressed in a single metric.

                  <p>
                    One-to-one trading networks (traditional definition of barter) are nearly all operated by a single
                    entity. You must create an account with that entity and typically have to pay a fee for each transaction
                    or a membership fee. Further, 1:1 or non-currency barter, suffers from what economists call the
                    &ldquo;double coincidence of wants&rdquo; requiring both sides to have something the other wants.
                    Because the AbundX allows exchanges between multiple people, it is much more likely to create a
                    circle of offers and needs than a one-to-one exchange.

                    When you join the exchange you select an alias. Everything you do in the exchange is associated with
                    this alias. There is no central controller that can link your alias with your real name. You can have
                    authorities validate claims you make without providing your real name or any other information about
                    yourself that you do not want to share with the entire exchange. For more information of how Verified

                      The Agent implementation allows Agents to Connect to Graphs instead of requiring everyone to connect

              <h2>The problem with currency</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> There are many much better descriptions of the problems with currency-based economies. Among them we
                recommend <a rel="external" href="http://tinyurl.com/sacredeconomicsatamazon">Eisenstein&rsquo;s <em>Sacred Economics</em></a>
                and <a rel="external" href="http://tinyurl.com/lifeincatamazon">Rushkoff&rsquo;s <em>Life Inc.</em></a> Here we attempt to
                present an abbreviated summary.
              </p>
              <p>
                A centralized currency creates artificial scarcity, which in turn gives the advantage to those with more of the central
                currency over those with less. The need to convert all value (goods or services) to the centralized currency allows for
                centralized control of the currency equivalent (financial instrument), which in turn results in inflated prices and more
                artificial scarcity. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The dependency on centralized currencies inhibits the exchange of goods and services where the currency is in short supply.
                Financial instruments create artificial scarcity and imbalances in the exchange of value as the trade of financial instruments
                captures more currency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bias of centralized currencies is to centralize. The rich get richer and locations with more currency accumulate it while
                locations that generate less currency will be able to retain less and less currency. The problems of Spain and Greece can be
                seen as the result of the Euro accumulating in wealthier nations and lack of currency inhibiting production and exchange of
                goods and services in poorer countries. The current problems in the US can be traced back to deregulation of banks in the
                1980&rsquo;s allowing national banks. The result was that savings were not invested locally, but in vehicles that made more
                money for the financial institution, and interest payments and banking fees are not put back into the local economy, but
                instead accumulated in banking centers like New York City.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nor does the problem with centralized currencies stop at national borders. National currencies are traded against currencies of
                wealthier nations. Debt in currencies from wealthier nations creates a flow of value to the wealthier nation in the form of
                debt and foreign ownership. When the debt cannot be met, then the World Bank steps in and lends the country more money in
                return for concessions that result in value leaving the country at a faster pace. That value may be natural resources, or labor
                to produce goods and services at lower rates than in wealthier nations. The result is higher prices for more goods produced
                locally and lower wages to buy them.
              </p>
              <p>
                A more subtle, but much more important problem with currency is requirement to reduce all value to a single metric. This
                discussion is beyond the scope of this presentation and has been well articulated by Charles Eisenstein in <em>Sacred
                Economics: Money Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition,</em> July 2011.
              </p>
              <h2>Non-Currency Exchanges</h2>
              <p>
                Creating centralized local exchanges may help with currency scarcity, but they are limited to facilitating exchange of like
                services (for example a baby sitting cooperative), or a one-to-one trading system (for example, farm work for tomatoes).
                Matching offers and needs between two people to make an exchange acceptable to both does not happen often enough to make this a
                viable alternative economy.
              </p>
              <h2>Non-Government Backed Currencies</h2>
              <p>
                Barter exchanges using an exchange currency, resource-based currencies, and locally issued currencies can be considered
                &ldquo;non-government backed currency&rdquo; for the purposes of this summary.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only manageable way to match needs with offers in a centralized exchange is to convert each good or service to some common
                value or local currency. This new non-government currency is still centralized and has all the liabilities of a national
                currency, only at a smaller scale. Even if it is based upon some valuable resource, like power or food, the tendency to tie the
                exchange, resource, or local currency to a wealthier economy will eventually lead to a steady flow of value out of the local
                economy or exchange network. The tendency to link non-government currency to the government currency minimizes any advantage
                the local currency brings while creating additional liabilities, such as instability, inflation, and debt in the larger
                currency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from the liabilities of a centralized currency, subjective value would be very hard to support in a centralized exchange.
                For example, Alice might be willing to work one hour a month from now for one and a half bushels of tomatoes today. Or Bill may
                be willing to pay two bushels for an hour of plumbing work from Alice, but only 1 bushel for an hour of plumbing from Paul. The
                semantics of the central exchange would have to be identified, standardized, implemented, thoroughly tested and understood by
                all participants before they could be useful.
              </p>
              <h2>Trust</h2>
              <p>
                Centralized local exchanges must also deal with the issue of trust. Tom, Alice, and Bill must all trust the central exchange to
                execute accurately and fairly. They must further trust the exchange to validate each participant. This leads to standardizing
                on the lowest common denominator rather than rewarding excellence.

                    People join the exchange by being introduced to the exchange by someone already connected to it. In other words,
                    anyone can use the bulletin board who has been told where it is located.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AbundX.com can help bootstrap exchanges by providing directory services and Introductions to new members, but
                    Abundant Exchanges can be established without AbundX.com involvement.

                    People join the exchange under an alias. This protects everyone&rsquo;s privacy. Everyone can see every message
                    posted by everyone else, but cannot know the identity of the person. People in the exchange can connect directly
                    to each other to exchange information outside of the exchange, if they wish. For example, if I wish to have someone
                    come to my house to pick up my couch.

                    Making an offer or expressing a need requires creating a message and assigning it to the exchange.  
                  <p>
                  <p>
                    For example, I have a couch I would like to exchange something for. I would create a message designated as an
                    &ldquo;offer&rdquo; and include one or more pictures and a description.

                    Members find messages by filtering based upon labels assigned to the posts. In our example, I would put various
                    labels on my couch, such as &ldquo;couch&rdquo;, &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;, &ldquo;gently used&rdquo;, and so on.
                    There is no predefined set of labels that people must use.

                  <p>
                    A participant can link any number of offers with any number of needs. When a circle of offers is identified by the
                    Agents involved, then each participant is notified that their offer has been conditionally accepted and a corresponding
                    need met. When all participants have agreed, then the transaction executes and all the offers and needs involved
                    change status to &ldquo;awaiting fulfillment.&rdquo;  When the offer is eventually delivered, then the AbundX
                    Agent&rsquo;s owner must acknowledge receipt by changing the need status to &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. Any additional
                    information can be added to the fulfilled need to contribute to the reputation system (see below).

                  <p>
                    If fulfilling and offer or receiving one requires personal information to be exchanged, like name and address, then
                    the parties involved in the giving and receiving must create a direct connection between their Agents. This is
                    accomplished by both parties requesting and then accepting an Introduction between their two Agents. Once connected,
                    each Agent can communicate with the other without the information being accessible to the exchange.

                  <p>
                    Anyone can provide verification of claims to the exchange. For example, I wish people in the exchange to know that I have
                    lived in Littletown for 20 years. I could arrange with my lawyer to validate (through his Agent) that information with
                    anyone in the exchange under the alias I am using. Someone who wants some indication I am trustworthy can present my
                    alias and claims to my lawyer (with or without using an Agent), who will validate my claims <em>after confirming with me
                    it is ok to do so.</em>  This can all be done automatically using Agents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can also agree with other exchange members to recommend me by acting as a verifier of claims that my Agent makes (as in a
                    peer-to-peer web of trust), by posting a testimonial message, or by reviewing a transaction favorably. Anyone in the
                    exchange can access all messages associated with me and thus draw their own conclusions regarding my trustworthiness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, validation of claims by authorities independent of the exchange, peer review, and history in the exchange create a
                    reputation system that is extremely difficult to game. Visualization and automation of this reputation system is a major
                    portion of the effort we hope to fund from the crowdfunding campaign.
