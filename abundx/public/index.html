              <h1>AbundX</h1>
              <p>
                Welcome to AbundX where we are building the AbundX Agent that can be used to create efficient
                and trustworthy peer to peer exchanges: Abundant Exchanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AbundX Agent is your personal online representative to help you participate in peer-to-peer
                exchanges while protecting your privacy and providing a robust reputation system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AbundX Agent will enable a multi-way exchange of goods and services without cash or a central authority. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In an Abundant Exchange, or AbundX, you can give something to one person and receive something you value as
                much or more from another person. The AbundX helps link a circle of people who each give something
                and receive something in return.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each person controls an application we call an AbundX Agent, that links with other Agents. People can
                create an authenticated and secure connection to each other through their Agents. This connection is
                called peer to peer because no central controller or coordinator is necessary for two Agents to
                communicate. <strong>Every AbundX Agent is equal and no Agent has special powers over other Agents.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to connecting one to one, Agents can connect to a group of Agents, we call a Graph.
                A message to the Graph can be accessed by any Agent in the Graph. An Abundant Exchange is a Graph
                of AbundX Agents who wish to exchange goods and services.
              </p>
              <p>
                A message posted to an AbundX is like posting to a bulletin board. Anyone who has access to the
                bulletin board can post and read any message, even those created before she became a member.
              </p>
              <p>
                Messages to an AbundX are offers and needs. AbundX Agents provide tools for sorting, filtering,
                and posting messages. An AbundX Agent can recognize when it is part of a closed loop of offers and needs.
                Each AbundX Agents in the circle participates in a distributed transaction that ensures that either
                everyone agrees to the exchange, or no one is obligated.
              </p>
              
              <h1>AbundX: A more detailed description</h1>
              <p>
                The technology we have developed facilitates a multi-way exchange of subjective value without
                conversion to a central currency or any requirement of a central authority or central exchange. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This multi-way exchange system more closely resembles pre-currency economies, but uses technology
                to be even more efficient, reliable, and secure than centralized currencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mechanisms for establishing secure connections independent of personal identity, enabling variable
                levels of trust, and verification of information through a Web of Provenance are provided in an
                infrastructure that is more secure than standard Internet technologies. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Key behaviors of the infrastructure are based upon a mathematical model and can be proven with
                formal methods. For more information about the enabling peer-to-peer technology we call &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;

              </p>
              <p>
                We have already done all the heavy lifting on our own dime. Many person years in sweat equity and
                hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone into defining and building the supporting technology to
                date. The only remaining technology barriers that need to be addressed are user experience
                improvements and installation streamlining. Both are well understood using established skill sets.
              </p>

                    Building robust, secure software applications is expensive, as less realistic attempts at similar
                    technologies have found out the hard way. We are all seasoned professionals with many complete
                    systems under our belts, so we have a high likelihood of meeting our estimates. The enhancements
                    necessary are &ldquo;few&rdquo; only in relation to what has been built so far. We have invested over 10
                    person-years in developing this technology and are asking for a small fraction of that to enhance
                    the technology so that it can be used for free by people. We are all working at subsistence
                    wages or below to make this number work.

                    Exchange in about 3 months. Allowing for &ldquo;scope creep&rdquo; and inevitable distractions, we cannot
                    commit to less than 4 months.

                    The money will be spent on a number of efforts necessary to support establishment of viable p2p
                    exchanges:  If we just make our goal and do not attract significant volunteer help, then we will
                    be able to deliver the minimum enhancements to make this technology useful for p2p exchanges.
                    Excess funding will fund additional user experience enhancements, education and training materials,
                    automation of AbundX Agent behaviors, and improving the ease of deploying AbundX Agents.With enough
                    extra funding we will provide direct assistance to crowd-selected Abundant Exchanges. About 20% will
                    be needed for indirect purposes such as administration, communications, and business infrastructure.
                    If we are funded, we will maintain a full accounting on our website of where we are spending your money.
                    See our project plan, which will be updated bi-monthly as funds are spent.

                  How can each person receive something of more value than what he or she gave?  Doesn&rsquo;t someone have to lose?

                    Because we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_division">all value different qualities differently</a>,
                    it is possible for everyone to get back more than what they gave. For example, when I have plenty of something
                    I may be willing to exchange it for something I need more. It is very possible, and perhaps typical, that
                    everyone in a circle of exchanges may consider what they receive to be of greater value than that was given.
                    In a centralized system, either currency or barter, someone probably looses, since the central authority
                    usually takes some percentage of every transaction.

                    <li>
                      There is no central authority to monitor exchanges, so there is no entity that can be made responsible for
                      reporting exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exchanges are not reduced to a dollar value, so assessing the dollar value of an exchange is open to wide
                      interpretation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exchanges are not limited to agreements between two people. There may be several people involved in a single
                      transaction. What is given is independent of what is received. In other words: my obligation to deliver an
                      offer is in effect even if the person delivering an offer to me reneges. My obligation to deliver is enforced
                      by a desire to maintain my reputation, not enforced by a contract.

                    Quite the opposite. Currency systems are much more &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; than a distributed exchange
                    system because currency systems are centrally controlled and require everything exchanged to be
                    reduced to a single measurement determined by the society. A distributed exchange system allows
                    each person to determine the qualities of goods and service he or she most values.

                    In addition to secure communications and privacy protections, using an Agent in an exchange allows
                    everyone in the exchange to see a history of transactions. History builds reputation and confidence
                    in the exchange allowing higher value goods and services to be exchanged and promises made (stored value)
                    over longer time periods. Communication through Agents provides assurances of the accuracy of claims
                    made through the Agent using the Web of Provenance.

                    You must create an account with that entity and typically have to pay a fee for each transaction or a
                    membership fee. Because the AbundX allows exchanges between multiple people, it is much more likely to
                    create a circle of offers and needs than a one-to-one exchange.

              <h2>The problem with currency</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> There are many much better descriptions of the problems with currency-based economies. Among them we recommend
                Eisenstein&rsquo;s <em>Sacred Economics</em> and Rushkoff&rsquo;s <em>Life Inc.</em>  Here we attempt to present an abbreviated summary.
              </p>
              <p>
                A centralized currency creates artificial scarcity, which in turn gives the advantage to those with more of the central currency
                over those with less. The need to convert all value (goods or services) to the centralized currency allows for centralized
                control of the currency equivalent (financial instrument), which in turn results in inflated prices and more artificial scarcity. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The dependency on centralized currencies inhibits the exchange of goods and services where the currency is in short supply. 
                Financial instruments create artificial scarcity and imbalances in the exchange of value as the trade of financial instruments
                captures more currency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bias of centralized currencies is to centralize. The rich get richer and locations with more currency accumulate it while
                locations that generate less currency will be able to retain less and less currency. The problems of Spain and Greece can be
                seen as the result of the Euro accumulating in wealthier nations and lack of currency inhibiting production and exchange of
                goods and services in poorer countries. The current problems in the US can be traced back to deregulation of banks in the
                1980&rsquo;s allowing national banks. The result was that savings were not invested locally, but in vehicles that made more
                money for the financial institution, and interest payments and banking fees are not put back into the local economy, but instead
                accumulated in banking centers like New York City.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nor does the problem with centralized currencies stop at national borders. National currencies are traded against currencies of
                wealthier nations. Debt in currencies from wealthier nations creates a flow of value to the wealthier nation in the form of debt
                and foreign ownership. When the debt cannot be met, then the World Bank steps in and lends the country more money in return for
                concessions that result in value leaving the country at a faster pace. That value may be natural resources, or labor to produce
                goods and services at lower rates than in wealthier nations. The result is higher prices for more goods produced locally and
                lower wages to buy them.
              </p>
              <p>
                A more subtle, but much more important problem with currency is requirement to reduce all value to a single metric. This discussion
                is beyond the scope of this presentation and has been well articulated by Charles Eisenstein in <em>Sacred Economics: Money
                  Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition,</em> July 2011.
              </p>
              <h2>Non-Currency Exchanges</h2>
              <p>
                Creating centralized local exchanges may help with currency scarcity, but they are limited to facilitating exchange of like services
                (for example a baby sitting cooperative), or a one-to-one trading system (for example, farm work for tomatoes). Matching offers
                and needs between two people to make an exchange acceptable to both does not happen often enough to make this a viable alternative
                economy.
              </p>
              <h2>Non-Government Backed Currencies</h2>
              <p>
                Barter exchanges using an exchange currency, resource-based currencies, and locally issued currencies can be considered
                &ldquo;non-government backed currency&rdquo; for the purposes of this summary.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only manageable way to match needs with offers in a centralized exchange is to convert each good or service to some common
                value or local currency. This new non-government currency is still centralized and has all the liabilities of a national
                currency, only at a smaller scale. Even if it is based upon some valuable resource, like power or food, the tendency to
                tie the exchange, resource, or local currency to a wealthier economy will eventually lead to a steady flow of value out
                of the local economy or exchange network. The tendency to link non-government currency to the government currency minimizes
                any advantage the local currency brings while creating additional liabilities, such as instability, inflation, and debt in
                the larger currency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from the liabilities of a centralized currency, subjective value would be very hard to support in a centralized
                exchange. For example, Alice might be willing to work one hour a month from now for one and a half bushels of tomatoes
                today. Or Bill may be willing to pay two bushels for an hour of plumbing work from Alice, but only 1 bushel for an hour
                of plumbing from Paul. The semantics of the central exchange would have to be identified, standardized, implemented,
                thoroughly tested and understood by all participants before they could be useful.
              </p>
              <h2>Trust</h2>
              <p>
                Centralized local exchanges must also deal with the issue of trust. Tom, Alice, and Bill must all trust the central exchange
                to execute accurately and fairly. They must further trust the exchange to validate each participant. This leads to
                standardizing on the lowest common denominator rather than rewarding excellence.

                    someone is offering yard work and I think 3 hours of yard work would be a fair exchange for the furniture.
                    The more flexible I am with what I can get in exchange, then the quicker my transaction will execute.

                    Creating an exchange is similar to defining a new address where everyone will post messages. Like putting notes on
                    a community bulletin board. AbundX.com will help coordinate establishment of Abundant Exchanges and provide a
                    directory service.

                  <p>
                    People join the exchange by being introduced to the exchange by someone already connected to it. In other words,
                    anyone can use the bulletin board who has been told where it is located.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AbundX.com can help bootstrap exchanges by providing directory serices and Introductions to new members, but
                    Abundant Exchanges can be established without AbundX.com involvement.

                  <p>
                    People join the exchange under an alias. This protects everyone&rsquo;s privacy. Everyone can see every message
                    posted by everyone else, but cannot know the identity of the person. People in the exchange can connect directly
                    to each other to exchange information outside of the exchange, if they wish. For example, if I wish to have someone
                    come to my house to pick up my couch.

                  <p>
                    For example, I have a couch I would like to exchange something for. I would create a message designated as an
                    &ldquo;offer&rdquo; and include one or more pictures and a description.

                    Members find messages by filtering based upon labels assigned to the posts. In our example, I would put various
                    labels on my couch, such as &ldquo;couch&rdquo;, &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;, &ldquo;gently used&rdquo;, and so on.
                    There is no predefined set of labels that people must use.

                    A participant can link any number of offers with any number of needs. When a circle of offers is identified by the
                    Agents involved, then each participant is notified that their offer has been conditionally accepted and a corresponding
                    need met. When all participants have agreed, then the transaction executes and all the offers and needs involved
                    change status to &ldquo;awaiting fulfillment.&rdquo;  When the offer is eventually delivered, then the AbundX
                    Agent&rsquo;s owner mush acknowledge receipt by changing the need status to &ldquo;complete&rdquo;. Any additional
                    information can be added to the fulfilled need to contribute to the reputation system (see below).

                  <p>
                    If fulfilling and offer or receiving one requires personal information to be exchanged, like name and address, then
                    the parties involved in the giving and receiving must create a direct connection between their Agents. This is
                    accomplished by both parties requesting and then accepting an Introduction between their two Agents. Once connected,
                    each Agent can communicate with the other without the information being accessible to the exchange.

                  <p>
                    Anyone can provide verification of claims to the exchange. For example, I wish people in the exchange to know that I have
                    lived in Littletown for 20 years. I could arrange with my lawyer to validate (through his Agent) that information with
                    anyone in the exchange under the alias I am using. Someone who wants some indication I am trust worthy can present my
                    alias and claims to my lawyer (with or without using an Agent), who will validate my claims <em>after confirming with me
                      it is ok to do so.</em>  This can all be done automatically using Agents
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can also agree with other exchange members to recommend me by acting as a verifier of claims my Agent makes (as in a
                    peer-to-peer web of trust), by posting a testimonial message, or by reviewing a transaction favorably. Anyone in the
                    exchange can access all messages associated with me and thus draw their own conclusions regarding my trustworthiness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, validation of claims by authorities independent of the exchange, peer review, and history in the exchange create a
                    reputation system that is extremely difficult to game. Visualization and automation of this reputation system is a major
                    portion of the effort we hope to fund from the Kickstarter campaign.
